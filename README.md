# UI developer test

here are 4 questions in this tests one in each folder, each with their own README.md file with instructions and information about each test,

The questions range into 4 areas
1) Javascript
2) react, rendering loops JSON
3) react forms
4) react Tests

An hour is given for this test and we don't expect you to complete all of them. this test allows us to have an idea how you structure code and how you approach problems.

All of these questions are worth the same, and we don't mind if you decide to do a small amount on each question or go deep into one specific question, whichever is easier for you.

If you proceed to the next interview, the answers of these questions will form a conversation as to why you picked which solutions, so please leave any code that is unfinished as this is also really useful.

**And more importantly, good luck and have fun!**
