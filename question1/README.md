# Question 1

Question 1 is about pure javascript we need to take the array of random characters, numbers and an object and `console.log` just the numbers in numeric order. 

So the output should be: 
1, 1, 2, 6, 22, 67, 123

Notes:
- Assume numbers in quotes are numbers, but objects are never numbers

## Running the code
`node question.js`
