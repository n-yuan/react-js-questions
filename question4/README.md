# Question 4

Question 4 is about tests, we have a simple react screen that has a list of buttons, clicking on each of these buttons updates the state and renders the result in an H2 element.

There is jest/enzyme and react testing library installed here and a couple of very basic snapshot tests as examples. use either of these testing platforms to write some better tests

If you don't know how to use either of these testing environments, please feel free to install the one you do know.

## Running tests

`npm run test`
