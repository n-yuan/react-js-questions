# Question 2

Question 2 is in react, in this folder is a simple react app that doesn't do much at the moment what we need is the data.JSON file to be loaded and rendered in a user-friendly way.

Create a new react component to display all the data in a table-style format, showing all the fields from the JSON data.

Please also format alternate rows of the table to have different colours so odd rows to be white and even to be #ddd;

Use any means you like to render the data, use a package from NPM, render basic HTML + CSS.

## Running the code
`npm start`

## The app should load onto
`http://localhost:3000/`
